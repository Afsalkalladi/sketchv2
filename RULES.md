# Project: Sketch Robotics Frontend

# Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React

## Design System Rules

1. **Theme:** Dark Mode strictly. Background is predominantly Black (#000000).
2. **Typography:** Sans-serif, modern, high contrast. Headings are often Uppercase.
   - Primary Text: White (#FFFFFF)
   - Secondary Text: Gray-400 or Gray-500
   - Accent Color: White (borders, buttons)
3. **Layout:**
   - Use `flex` and `grid` for layouts.
   - Mobile-first approach (use `md:` and `lg:` prefixes).
   - Sections usually have high vertical padding (`py-20` or `py-24`).

## Coding Standards

1. Use `lucide-react` for icons.
2. Use `export default function` for components.
3. strictly use Tailwind classes. Do not create CSS modules unless absolutely necessary.
4. Images: Use `next/image` component.
5. Components: Keep them small and in `src/components`.
